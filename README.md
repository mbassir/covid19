Optimal control and mathematical modeling of the spread of COVID-19 with multiple delays and among different age groups

# Optimal control with delay
1. In order to compute optimal control with delay for delay states T=0, T=10 and T=25, go to the folder "optimal-control-delay", and run the script "main_delay.m". After running it, all SEIR variables and controls u, v, w and z for the three delay states will be saved in a mat file named "covid_retard_SEIHR_and_controls.mat".

2. In order to plot the evolution of each variable/control for all delay states, run the script "plot_delay.m".
